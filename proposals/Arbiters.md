Currently Philly Socialists has two constitutionally mandated arbiters, whose job is to help resolve conflicts and disputes, as well as provide a check and balance on CC overreach. As the organization grows and brings in more people, the likelihood of personality conflicts, feuds hurt feelings, etc. also increases.

This proposal recommends we put the elected Arbiters at the head of a small working group with the following responsibilities and expectations: 1) Place an emphasis on "branch service" meaning proactive engagement by Arbiters within the branches. This would mean mandatory in person "check­ins" with a different branch every month (by attending meetings and socials). Arbiters must build relationships with rank­and­file members at the branch level and proactively offer emotional support, mental health check ins, conflict resolution. Arbiters will also oversee job placement, housing placement, and help direct members toward additional social services at their request.
