**Political Education and Leadership Development Proposal**

Philly Socialists is in need of a more robust and comprehensive political education program. We also need to continue to acculturate new members into our organizational practices (in part through "orientation" events such as Camp Cadre. Finally, the organization must continually be on the lookout for members with leadership potential, providing learning opportunities and mentorship of emerging leaders, etc. special attention must be paid to offset barriers to involvement among historically marginalized demographics, especially comrades who identify as female or from an oppressed nationality. A functional political education and leadership arm will uphold and implement a "branch service" orientation, delivering in足person workshops to every branch 2足3 times a year (6足9 events per year total). We will also endeavor to organize 1足2 high profile citywide educational forums featuring engaging speakers of national renown. This body will uphold the political line of the whole organization, reduce ting members on topics of interest to members rather than of interest to the committee. It will operate under the direction of the General Assembly and the Central Committee.
