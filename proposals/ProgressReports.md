**Monthly Progress Reports from Branches, Committees, and Groups**

Setting goals and keeping track of how successfully those goals are being met is an essential part of making progress. This is as true within organizations as it is for individuals. The Black Panthers, for instance, required their members to make daily progress reports on what work they had done to further the organization.

Within organizations, transparent assessments of performance helps connect leadership to the larger membership, provides a measure of accountability, and motivates executing on initiatives. Therefore, in the interest of progress, accountability, and transparency, all committees, branches, and groups will provide members of Philly Socialists with a brief monthly report on their activities. Each committee, branch, and working group will be encouraged to set goals of their own choosing in addition to those mandated by the Congress.

Branch reports will include, at minimum, the number of new members recruited to Philly Socialists, simple income and expenditure totals, and a summary of activity.

Central Committee reports will include, at minimum, a statement of finances, membership numbers, and any major decisions made during the month.

Autonomous and affinity group reports should reflect their progress on achieving the goals mandated for them by the Congress.

Should the creation of the SPP listserv be approved by the Congress, the reports will be posted to the SPP listserv. Should the SPP listserv not be approved by the Congress, the reports will be posted to the Theory listserv.
