#### 2015 Fundraising Plan

**Background**

Previously, Tim was given a stipend of $200/month for fundraising activity with the goal of signing up 20 dues­paying members. As of January 2nd, he has been able to sign up five new members for a total of $60/month. There are a number of other people who have verbally committed but have yet to sign up, and many more he has yet to ask. He feels confident that he can continue to approach individuals with some success on a similar timeline (5 dues­paying members per two months) He has prepared an Indiegogo campaign that is ready to roll out immediately, pending approval by the Congress. Perks will include newly-designed t­shirts, hoodies, posters, and original art.

**Proposal**

1. Philly Socialists will launch an Annual Fundraising Drive immediately after approval from the Congress. The goal will be to raise between $10,000 to $12,000 by the end of January.

2. This money will mainly be used to fund stipends to two (2) organizers for $400 a month over the course of one year (Jan 1, 2015 to Jan 1, 2016).

3. Additional money will allow us to roll out a third organizer later in the year if a qualified candidate emerges at that time.

4. At present, proposed organizers to receive stipends are Tim and David Thompson.

5. Fundraising goals are as follows:

+ Secure two (2) one­time donations of over $1,000 each
+ Secure five (5) one­time donations of approx. $500 each, for a total of $2,500
+ Secure ten (10) one­time donations of approx. $100 each, for a total of $1,000
+ Secure fifty (50) one­time donations of approx. $25 each, for a total of $1,250.
+ Secure fifty (50) donations of $10 or less for a total of $500.

6. In addition, Tim will continue to attempt to sign up new members at a rate of 5 members per 2 months. At this rate we will sign up 30 new members by the end of the year, for a total of 70 dues­paying members by December 2015.

7. Ideally we will exceed these goals and end the year with 80­100 dues-paying members.

8. Stipended organizers will operate as independent contractors (consultants). They will be responsible for filling out their own taxes at end of year 2015.

9. Costs of fundraising campaign:

+ Indiegogo takes 4% of total amount raised via campaign (4% or between $400­500)
+ Cost of t­shirts, hoodies, and additional schwag ($10/shirt)
