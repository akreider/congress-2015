**Central Committee**

The Central Committee will transition into a spokescouncil capable of making decisions on the fly (providing leadership), quickly responding to political events with statements or actions, and seizing opportunities in a rapidly evolving political environment. At this time the CC will be responsible for implementing recruitment on a citywide basis, managing the treasury, speaking on behalf of Philly Socialists to the broader public, building relationships with allies, and fundraising.

The CC is a grueling responsibility, and has historically tended to burn people out. For this reason, as well as in the interests of making it easier to come to consensus quickly, I propose we devolve the CC from 7 members down to 5.
