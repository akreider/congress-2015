Media Proposal

Introduction
After abolishing the spokesperson role at the January 2014 Congress, the Philly Socialists do not have any specified person or body that has responsibility for doing media work.


Proposal
The Central Committee will handle media strategy for organizational wide matters including general media requests, protest contingents, trainings, Philadelphia politics, etc.  The Central Committee will organize at least one media strategy training in 2015.

The branches will handle media strategy for their branch work.

The projects will handle media strategy for their project work.

Our media strategy should reflect our organization's values.

 “Science - Prove it”. For instance, we should never intentionally inflate the number of people at an event or the size of our organization.  

“Democracy - Everyone decides”.  We are a pluralist organization and we should represent this diversity of opinion.  For instance, we can create talking points on matters where there is  overwhelming agreement (ex. we believe that all humans have the right to quality housing) - but not on things where the members disagree (ex. Lenin vs Trotsky vs Mao, or whether we should be running someone for political office).

And we should also acknowledge, as stated in the conclusion of our constitution, when there are things that we don't know that “We admit our own ignorance.”
