*What kinds of things would you expect to advocate for within the leadership? This could be a question of strategy, political priorities, projects, initiatives, etc.*

I strongly believe in making our organization more amenable to oppressed individuals and demographics, as well as creating safe spaces for such individuals in our organization. 

This can be accomplished in part by continued refining of how we promote ourselves and continued training on how to communicate in a non-aggressive, open, warm way about political topics, which tend to make people communicate in the opposite way. More diversified and refined propaganda would also assist with this goal. 

Continuing to support the Women's Caucus, as well as inviting other members of oppressed groups to create caucuses within Philly Socialists is another tactic I would promote. Retooling and refocusing on our Children's Caucus (Childcare for members' children during events/meetings) is also important to me.

I support starting a second Worker-Tenant Solidarity Network in the Kensington branch, I believe this is a project that speaks directly to our values, connects us with the working class, and is something no one else is doing (in Philly anyway).

I'm also interested in building on the fundraising work Tim has been conducting to work towards getting more Philly Socialists members paid. Aside from paying members via fundraising, I'm quite interested in pursuing a low-start-up-cost Philly Socialists co-op so that we may begin to employ more of our people. I would like to start a working group around this at the Kensington Branch.   

*What qualities or positive attributes would you bring to the organizational leadership?*

I consider myself a good communicator and listener, and a people person. I spend my day job working with individuals in low-income communities and am able to remain professional yet sympathetic. I am sensitive to the needs of those who have been more oppressed than others under capitalism. I spend much of my day job tabling so I'm quite comfortable approaching people to discuss Philly Socialists. I'm also extremely organized, an Excel whiz, and enjoy putting on events.

*If elected, what do you see yourself doing for the organization next year?*

I will be a dedicated member of the central committee, fulfilling all responsibilities that come with it. I will be able to do so in part by dropping down to part-time at my day job, I have already spoken to my boss about working 4 days a week, which she is open to, and if it does not happen by late spring I will begin to search for alternative, part-time positions. 

I will support the start of a Solidarity Network in Kensington, continue to hold gatherings of the women's caucus with Melissa and other women interested in being involved, strategize on how to get more Philly Socialists members paid --possibly through the pursuit of a co-op (if the idea is supported), and contribute to a propaganda campaign to paint a vision of what socialism could look like. 

I would also like to pledge to put on another Late Night with Late Capitalism variety show as I did in 2012, which served as a fundraiser, social event, and entertainment.

*What do you think are the group's biggest strengths? What will you do to help build on these strengths?*

I believe that everyone in Philly Socialists has their heart in the right place. One is not interested in socialism because of self-interest. I think we are great at running projects in a professional, organized fashion. The self-reflexivity of the organization also has been key to it's refinement and growth. I will contribute to the proposed projects in Kensington branch as well as providing an open, honest voice about what's working and what's not.

*What are our group's biggest weaknesses? What will you do to help mitigate or downplay our weaknesses?*

I think we need to be better about working with oppressed groups and individuals and making space for them in our organization. The way we communicate with each other and those outside the group, as well as on our listservs, is something that must be more thoughtful and less aggressive. More and better propaganda will be necessary to attract those not already socialist-curious. We also need to refocus and organize our Children's Caucus childcare program for members' children. See above for how I will contribute.

*Give us an idea of some of the kinds of things you have done on behalf of the group. What kind of work have you done for Philly Socialists?*

This past year, I served as Arbiter. I sat on the Central Committee the year before that. I have organized, with the help of others, all the women's caucus events. For the past two leadership retreats I have presented on interpersonal communication skills. In summer 2012 I organized the variety show/fundraiser event A Late Night with Late Capitalism. In late 2012 I organized a reading group of The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex. I've hosted a social event and regularly attended Philly Socialists events and meetings. You can always count on me to make phone calls!
