Central Committee

*What kinds of things would you expect to advocate for within the leadership? This could be a question of strategy, political priorities, projects, initiatives, etc.*

I believe that our organization will grow in the way we want it to if the leadership prioritizes creating political action opportunities for members. So if I'm elected to the Central Committee, I will push for expanding our efforts to organize tenants. But I will also advocate us branching out to organize at other sites of exploitation--workers against bosses, debtors against creditors, neighbors against developers. Given our organization's commitment to our internal cohesion, and given our proven record of strategic development, I believe we are well positioned to win increasingly significant struggles against capital. These struggles will build our political capacities, sharpen our understandings of power structures, and forge solidarity. In this way, they are important for our membership. But they are also important for our goal of reaching and inspiring people nationwide. Victories against capital, especially victories that result from leftist-led campaigns, are rare in today. Ours will highlight the promise of the Philly Socialists model. I will work toward converting disparate campaigns into a sustainable worker-tenant(-debtor-neighbor) union of people in Philadelphia committed to mutual aid.

Though my primary interest is in work that "Fights the Power," I support our Serve the People projects and will advocate continuing and further professionalizing both our ESL and GED courses. I will advocate a better commitment to breaking down social barriers between our members and the people we serve while we conduct these programs.

Finally, I will advocate beefing up Philly Socialists' member services along the lines proposed in Tim's Social Services Department proposal. I will encourage setting up regular, accessible, and approachable political education opportunities for members and the public.

*What qualities or positive attributes would you bring to the organizational leadership?*

I am approachable, flexible, easygoing, and work well in collaborations. I enjoy the work of getting to know other people and I work hard to turn their hopes into reality. I am a collaborative worker with a demonstrated willingness to take on necessary but unglamorous tasks. I follow through on my commitments. 

*If elected, what do you see yourself doing for the organization next year?*

Over the course of my year in a leadership position for the West Philly branch, I've come to think that my greatest contribution to the branch and its campaigns has been my ability to make real connections with many different types of people and personalities. So, I will do more to leverage this capacity for our organization. I will work to increase West Philly's membership via personal outreach. I will assist members in helping them see projects, goals, or tasks of theirs get accomplished. I will build off my work doing outreach to working class and oppressed Philadelphians with bad landlords or bosses, and I will work to build up cadre's skills in doing the same. I will do my best to stay plugged in to the concerns and hopes of the rank-and-file and will endeavor to connect with (or facilitate others' connections with) as many members as possible.
More concretely, I will actively work to double the membership of the West Philly branch, do logistics for RED Talks and other political education events, maintain a robust and creative social schedule for the West Philly branch, assist the Arbiters with implementing member services, perform outreach for solidarity network campaigns, help guide those campaigns with other solidarity network leaders, and help plan and show up at recruitment events for all three branches. 

*What do you think are the group's biggest strengths? What will you do to help build on these strengths?*

Philly Socialists' biggest strengths are its focus on project work and its commitment to building relationships between its members. It is no easy task to build an organization in a historical moment in which groups, associations, and institutions of all types are on the decline across the West. Few political groups have conscientiously grappled with what it takes to swim against this stream. Philly Socialists has. Our project work makes observable changes in the lives of others without the mediating influence of a corrupt nonprofit or a patronizing charity. Doing this work lets people experience the kind of fulfillment that is difficult to come by in a period marked by disintegrating families, bullshit jobs, income insecurity, and the unmitigated proliferation of spectacle. Our focus on our relationships gives us sources of comfort and inspiration as we go about doing our political work. That a revolutionary party requires the building of both working and social relationships was self-evident to the mighty Left formations of America's past, but today Philly Socialists is an outlier for including both aspects of people's lives in its organizing work. So I will work to make serious improvements both in projects and in the social life of our group in ways I describe above.

*What are our group's biggest weaknesses? What will you do to help mitigate or downplay our weaknesses?*

We can do better getting people who do not speak English as a first language involved in our organization. We can do better at getting people who didn't finish high school involved in our organization. We can do better getting tenants with bad landlords involved in our organization. I will work to disprove the notion that achieving this is unattainable because those we serve are too oppressed to have the time or interest to get involved in a political group. Neither my own experience nor my knowledge of history leads me to believe that this view is well-founded. It's exhausting work "bridging the gap," but we gotta do it.

*Give us an idea of some of the kinds of things you have done on behalf of the group. What kind of work have you done for Philly Socialists?*

The first real work I did for Philly Socialists was organizing a benefit show for it in late 2013. Following that, I helped get the West Philly branch off the ground along with Aaron Krieder, Julia Stone, and Melissa Elfont in 2014. I served as chair of the branch's organizing committee. I've contributed to the administrative work of the branch--putting together tabling events, booking space, creating agendas, facilitating branch meetings, and organizing social events. I've worked to keep West Philly branch members cohesive and to maintain the health of our working relationships.

I proposed the Solidarity Network project and have worked with a fantastic team to successfully implement it in two campaigns.
