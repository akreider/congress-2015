*What kinds of things would you expect to advocate for within the leadership? This could be a question of strategy, political priorities, projects, initiatives, etc.*

We should continue firming up gains we've made over the past year. We've managed to build a strong West Philly branch that's done some really phenomenal work (especially entering into new arenas such as tenant organizing). We're poised to continue our expansion both by launching a South Philly branch and by deepening ties with newly-emerging red collectives in Kentucky. We've been able to put forward strong showings at protest events, which is new to us. Our fundraising capacity has increased dramatically. 

In terms of new focus for the new year, my overall focus will be on strengthening our internal cohesion, capacity, and fighting strength and spirit. My strategy consists of three components: 1) Political education, 2) Cultural organizing, 3) Worker/tenant organizing. I see several potential opportunities for this. 

1. Political Education. I intend to further expand our theoretical apparatus, cultivating a stable of dynamic speakers and intellectuals, using methods such as branch-level REDTalks, film screenings, and eventually a day-school conference. In terms of theory, I am pursuing a deeper engagement with the politics of intersectionality and digitally-planned economies and intend to promote both of these schools of thought.

2. Cultural Organizing. Philly Socialists has always been predicated on the idea of what Jane McAlevey calls "whole worker organizing." People don't leave their class relations behind when they leave the workplace. We need a movement which can speak to multiple parts of people's lives and personalities, including their cultural needs. I feel something Philly Socialists did better in the early days was have a tighter connection with artists and musicians, with the various cultural scenes going on in the city, and a stronger emphasis on creative expression and linking this with the idea of an emancipated world. If it's feasible, I think we should consider putting together an arts and cultural festival over the summer. Additionally, the idea we had had for the youth program is still relevant, I feel, but we didn't really have the resources to fully invest in the project, and we probably should have narrowed our focus (e.g. toward high school students rather than all-ages). We may not be positioned to implement an arts or youth program this year, but we should try to lay the groundwork so we can take on such a program in earnest in 2016. 

3. Worker/tenant organizing. My goal would be to leverage the Solidarity Network organizing model into workplace and citywide organizing drives. I want us to help build durable working class organizations, moving from individual struggles to apartment or neighborhood-wide tenants associations, finally to citywide tenants associations and beyond. I also feel we'll be presented with numerous opportunities for direct workplace organizing. Many of our members have precarious jobs, and it's quite possible that opportunities will arise to instigate or be on the front lines of one or more workplace struggles among low-wage workers. Our movement should begin in earnest a vigorous discussion on the prospects of worker organizing today -- where is strategic to organize workers, how, and to what ends? But of course, practice is always the greatest teacher, and we've learned from the Winchester fight that the power of organized people can be greater than the power of laws, media buzz, or the fickle favor or politicians. We can also bring our considerable resources to bear on such fights, having built up a wide network of support through our cultural, intellectual and social work, and so long as we continue to focus on building up cadre through concrete project work.

*What qualities or positive attributes would you bring to the organizational leadership?*

I have a strong vision for the vision of the future and for what we can do locally and nationally. I'm adaptable, flexible, and I work hard.

*If elected, what do you see yourself doing for the organization next year?*

Careful attention needs to be paid to consolidating our gains, building stronger internal ties, and boosting our capacity at the branch level. I will be focusing on helping rebuild capacity in the Kensington branch, and helping launch and grow up a South Philly branch. Besides this, I want to focus on the above organization-wide initiatives, and attempt to keep growing our membership and our revenues. Down the road I'd eventually like to transition more exclusively into fundraising.

*What do you think are the group's biggest strengths? What will you do to help build on these strengths?*

Our people are our greatest strength. We have dedicated activist cadre, and a solid and long-standing network of sympathizers and supporters. I'd like to focus next year on consolidating our base by presenting multiple "points of contact" or ways to plug in and stay connected with the organization. We need to aggressively go out and meet new people. Finally, we need to do a better job of building people up as organizers, and giving them the support they need to grow. I will redouble my efforts to connect person-to-person with our membership, try to be a better mentor, and personally spearhead recruitment events.

*What are our group's biggest weaknesses? What will you do to help mitigate or downplay our weaknesses?*

We have a highly underdeveloped communications apparatus. We have a great story to tell, but we aren't really that great at telling it. We lack competent cadre who can regularly handle stuff like: graphic design, video, social media, messaging, etc. My goal is to recruit or train a team to be able to handle these operations by the end of the year. This will be predicated on our ability to get the right people in the door and keep them around. I'm also hoping a turn toward cultural organizing will help us find more "creative" types.

*Give us an idea of some of the kinds of things you have done on behalf of the group. What kind of work have you done for Philly Socialists?*

I've worked on pretty much every project. 

*Other comments?*

I also endorse Loren for Master of Ceremonies, with the proviso a suitable rap name is agreed upon.
