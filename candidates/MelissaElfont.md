*Position(s) you are running for*

Central Committee

*What kinds of things would you expect to advocate for within the leadership? This could be a question of strategy, political priorities, projects, initiatives, etc.*

+ The continuation and growth of our current projects and new projects developed during the year. 

+ A focus on recruiting to make a more diverse organization- tabling at LGBTQ events, cultural festivals, women's events, etc. and leading by example- taking my role as a leader seriously and being a good representative of Philly Socialists. 

*What qualities or positive attributes would you bring to the organizational leadership?*

I am committed to creating diversity within our organization and empowering women and minorities as members and leaders. I am good at building relationships with supporters and members, making newcomers feel comfortable and welcome, and working with/managing large groups (eg- tutors and students). I am dedicated to getting work done, even if that means doing boring/tedious/unpleasant things. I believe my feminist sensibilities are necessary and helpful in an arena that is usually dominated by men. Also I am a kickass baker. 

*If elected, what do you see yourself doing for the organization next year?*

I want to create an organizational culture that very different from typical leftist (AKA white male) groups- we're partway there but there's definitely room to grow. I will recruit new members through tabling, outreach, and relationship building. I will continue to co-lead the GED project in 2015 and will support the Solidarity Network through their current fight and any new fights that come up as the year progresses. My personal goal is to become a better strategic thinker. 

*What do you think are the group's biggest strengths? What will you do to help build on these strengths?*

The groups biggest strengths are the people and people's dedication to do good work. My biggest frustration with other activist/political groups is that sometimes, very little gets done even though everyone wants to create change. I can see change happening through the work of the group and it re-motivates me to do more work and create more change. I will help build on these strengths by recruiting new members, building personal relationships with and empowering them within the group, and supporting those who want to become leaders. 

*What are our group's biggest weaknesses? What will you do to help mitigate or downplay our weaknesses?*

Lack of diversity and women both in leadership positions and in the group in general. Unfortunately this is a cyclical problem, so it's difficult to recruit people to a group when they don't see people like themselves already in the group. I believe the solution is to continue reaching outward to populations/communities that we have not yet reached- the project do a really great job of that so I want to build on what we are already doing. More tutors and students for the GED/ESL classes. Another fight for the SolNet. More socials. 

*Give us an idea of some of the kinds of things you have done on behalf of the group. What kind of work have you done for Philly Socialists?*

Co-led the GED program in 2014. 

Served on the West Philly branch Organizing Committee. 

Currently organizing the women's caucus with Ariel (Feb. 28th lady friends!). 

Participated in the Solidarity Network's first fight. 

Did a ton of tabling last summer and fall and helped organize a bake sale (with Emily and Aaron K.) at the Dollar Stroll to raise money for the GED program.
