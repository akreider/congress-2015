**Position(s) you are running for**

Central Committee

**What kinds of things would you expect to advocate for within the leadership? This could be a question of strategy, political priorities, projects, initiatives, etc.**

My main strategic objective will be to continue to grow our base of both the oppressed and the exploited. But, my emphasis will be on the most exploited workers. I.e., high-skill workers. Their participation is necessary to win and build Socialism yet they are not currently being organized by anyone on the Left. This will entail coming up with novel methods of outreach (speaking at Nerd Nite, Bar Camp, and other non-political events), crafting propaganda geared at the new base, and making a popular scientific case for the superiority of Socialism over Capitalism.

My secondary objective will be to build a cognitively diverse and talented organization. I will help achieve this mainly through political education that appeals to a wide range of interests while also uniting them all under the same banner of Socialism.

**What qualities or positive attributes would you bring to the organizational leadership?**

I am an analytical and strategic thinker with 12 years of political experience. I have a deep commitment to not only help grow Philly Socialists, but also to build a better US Left.

This essentially means two things. First, I am more interested in the right answer than I am in being right. Second, I won't settle for the same accepted answers on which other individuals and groups converge. The result, hopefully, is innovative thought.

**If elected, what do you see yourself doing for the organization next year?**

I plan to be on the ground helping with everyday tasks in the Kensington branch. Mainly, I'll be helping to retain members by organizing social events.

I'll also take a leadership role in political education. This will mean scheduling speakers, booking space, and otherwise organizing events. It will also mean crafting curricula for events like Camp Cadre and the Leadership Retreat. My aim will be meaningful diversity.

Lastly, I'll provide intellectual cover from above via a blog and limited speaking engagements. It's not necessary that every member understand how we would compute value under Socialism, et al., but they do need to know that someone understands it...and that that person is accessible to them.

**What do you think are the group's biggest strengths? What will you do to help build on these strengths?**

Our biggest strength is our members' willingness to put their money where their values are. I will help to make sure that their time and money is directed toward a strategic end. Also, I'll help to develop their skills, leadership abilities, and confidence.

**What are our group's biggest weaknesses? What will you do to help mitigate or downplay our weaknesses?**

Because our goals are long-term, we sometimes have difficulty attracting the interest of activists as well as maintaining the interest of our members. It's easy to get caught up in the flow of whatever is in the news...to follow history instead of craft it. Likewise, it's easy to get bored doing the often rote work of building a movement.

I will push for a strategy that captures the popular imagination by not simply fighting against Capitalism but by also fighting for Socialism. To me, this means constantly pushing the envelope with exciting projects and novel ways of reach out to the masses.

**Give us an idea of some of the kinds of things you have done on behalf of the group. What kind of work have you done for Philly Socialists?**

I was the first project leader of ESL in 2010. I was the project leader for the free internet project. I helped launch the community garden project. I developed the curriculum for Camp Cadre and half of the curriculum for the Leadership Retreat. I made the logo. I've been on the Central Committee for three years and have had a large effect on the structure and strategy of the organization. Lots of stuff.
